COMMAND: /sp.specify "2. Integrated RAG Chatbot Development: Build and embed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot within the published book. This chatbot, utilizing the OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres database, and Qdrant Cloud Free Tier, must be able to answer user questions about the book's content, including answering questions based only on text selected by the user." ## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_ ### User Story 1 - Ask a question about the book (Priority: P1) As a reader, I want to ask a question in a chat interface and receive a relevant answer based on the content of the entire book, so that I can quickly clarify concepts without searching manually. **Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the chatbot and provides the primary value to the user. **Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the chat interface, asking a question related to the book's content, and verifying that a relevant answer is returned. **Acceptance Scenarios**: 1. **Given** a reader is viewing the book, **When** they open the chatbot and type a question about the book's content, **Then** the chatbot should display a relevant answer based on the book's content. 2. **Given** a reader asks a question that is not related to the book's content, **When** they submit the question, **Then** the chatbot should respond that it can only answer questions about the book. --- ### User Story 2 - Ask a question about selected text (Priority: P2) As a reader, I want to highlight a specific passage of text and ask a question about just that selection, so that I can get a highly contextual answer. **Why this priority**: This enhances the chatbot's utility by allowing for more specific and focused queries. **Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting a piece of text, triggering the "ask about selection" feature, and verifying that the answer is based only on the selected text. **Acceptance Scenarios**: 1. **Given** a reader has selected a snippet of text, **When** they activate the contextual chat feature and ask a question, **Then** the chatbot's answer is based solely on the selected text snippet. --- ## Requirements _(mandatory)_ ### Functional Requirements - **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a chat interface accessible from within the book's pages. - **FR-002**: The system MUST allow users to submit text-based questions. - **FR-003**: The system MUST process user questions to understand their intent. - **FR-004**: The system MUST be able to search and retrieve relevant content from the book. - **FR-005**: The system MUST generate answers based on the retrieved content. - **FR-006**: The system MUST be able to scope its answers to the entire book. - **FR-007**: The system MUST be able to scope its answers to a user-selected text snippet. - **FR-008**: The system MUST inform the user when it cannot answer a question from the provided context. - **FR-009**: The system MUST be fully responsible for processing the book content, including: - Chunking the book text - Generating embeddings for all content - Storing embeddings in the vector database (Qdrant) - Performing retrieval during user queries - Users MUST NOT be required to manually upload, manage, or configure embeddings or retrieval logic. ### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_ - **User Question**: The query submitted by the user. Contains the text of the question and the context (entire book or selected text). - **Book Content Chunk**: A segment of the book's text, used for indexing and retrieval. - **Chatbot Answer**: The response generated by the system. Contains the answer text and references to the source content. ### Assumptions - The book's content is available in a format that can be processed and indexed. - The proposed technical stack (OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres database, and Qdrant Cloud Free Tier) is approved for implementation. ## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_ ### Measurable Outcomes - **SC-001**: At least 90% of user questions about the book's content receive a relevant answer. - **SC-002**: The average response time for a question is less than 5 seconds. - **SC-003**: For questions about selected text, the chatbot's answer is derived from the selection in at least 95% of cases. - **SC-004**: The chatbot feature achieves a user satisfaction rating of at least 4 out of 5."
