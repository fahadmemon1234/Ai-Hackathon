## Response snapshot

I have updated the project constitution and ensured consistency across the relevant project templates.

- Updated `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with a new set of principles and a governance model.
- Updated `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` to reflect the new constitutional principles in its "Constitution Check" section.
- Verified that no changes were needed in `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` and `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`.
