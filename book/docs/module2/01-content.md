# Module 2: NVIDIA Isaac Sim Basics

Welcome to Module 2! In this module, we'll dive into the basics of NVIDIA's Isaac Sim, a powerful robotics simulation platform.

## What is Isaac Sim?

NVIDIA Isaac Sim is a robotics simulation toolkit built on NVIDIA Omniverse. It provides a realistic, physically-accurate simulation environment for developing, testing, and training AI-based robots.

## Key Features

- **Photorealistic rendering**: Create stunning, realistic environments for your simulations.
- **Physics-based simulation**: Accurately simulate the behavior of robots and their interactions with the environment.
- **ROS/ROS 2 integration**: Seamlessly connect your ROS-based robotics applications to Isaac Sim.
- **Python scripting**: Customize and extend the simulation environment using Python.

## Your First Simulation

In this section, we'll walk through the process of creating a simple "hello world" simulation in Isaac Sim.

### 1. Launch Isaac Sim

Once you have Isaac Sim installed, launch the application.

### 2. Create a New Stage

Create a new, empty stage to build your simulation.

### 3. Add a Ground Plane

Add a ground plane to provide a surface for your robot to stand on.

### 4. Add a Robot

Import a robot model into your scene. For this example, we'll use one of the built-in robot models.

### 5. Run the Simulation

Press the "Play" button to start the simulation and see your robot in action!

## Next Steps

In the next module, we'll explore how to control your robot in Isaac Sim using ROS 2.
