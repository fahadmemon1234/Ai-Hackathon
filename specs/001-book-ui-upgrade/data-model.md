## Summary

This feature focuses exclusively on enhancing the User Interface and User Experience of an existing Docusaurus-based technical book. It does not introduce any new data entities, modify existing data structures, or require persistence of new application-specific data. All operations are client-side rendering and styling adjustments to existing Markdown/MDX content.

## Entities
