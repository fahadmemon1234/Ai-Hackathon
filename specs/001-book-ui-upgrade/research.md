# Research for Book UI Upgrade

**Purpose**: Document research findings to resolve technical unknowns or identify best practices.
**Created**: December 7, 2025
**Feature**: [specs/001-book-ui-upgrade/spec.md](specs/001-book-ui-upgrade/spec.md)

## Summary of Research Findings

This feature focuses on enhancing the UI/UX of an existing Docusaurus book. The requirements primarily involve applying CSS styling and potentially creating custom React components within the Docusaurus framework. All technical aspects are considered to be within the standard capabilities and best practices of Docusaurus theming and styling. Therefore, no explicit research was required to resolve technical unknowns or identify new technologies. The implementation will follow established Docusaurus customization patterns (e.g., using `custom.css`, component overriding).

## Decisions and Rationale

**Decision**: Proceed with implementation using standard Docusaurus theming and styling mechanisms.
**Rationale**: The feature specification does not introduce new technologies or complex architectural challenges that would necessitate extensive research. Existing Docusaurus capabilities are sufficient to meet all functional requirements.
**Alternatives considered**: N/A (no alternatives to the core Docusaurus platform were considered as per the project constraints).
