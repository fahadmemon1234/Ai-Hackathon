# Implementation Plan: Book UI Upgrade

**Branch**: `001-book-ui-upgrade` | **Date**: 2025-12-07 | **Spec**: [specs/001-book-ui-upgrade/spec.md](specs/001-book-ui-upgrade/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-book-ui-upgrade/spec.md`

## Summary

The primary goal is to upgrade the UI, styling, and presentation of the Docusaurus-based technical book "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" to be more professional, readable, and visually appealing for a technical audience. The technical approach involves leveraging Docusaurus's theming capabilities to introduce modern typography, enhanced module layouts (card-like boxes), styled tables, visual emphasis for key terms, distinct callout boxes, code block styling, structured lists, and ensuring consistent, responsive design. All changes will be confined to styling and presentation within the `/docs` content, strictly preserving existing book structure, file names, paths, and configuration.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript, React (used by Docusaurus), Markdown/MDX  
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React  
**Storage**: Filesystem (Markdown/MDX content, static assets)  
**Testing**: Manual visual inspection, Docusaurus build/serve commands, browser developer tools for responsiveness and styling validation.  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (desktop and mobile, responsive design)  
**Project Type**: Web application (Static site generated by Docusaurus)  
**Performance Goals**: Maintain fast page loads and smooth user experience inherent to Docusaurus. (Implicit performance goal from Docusaurus itself)  
**Constraints**:
-   Existing book structure, sidebar, category JSONs, and content must remain fully intact.
-   Only `/docs` content for UI, styling, and presentation will be modified.
-   Backward compatibility with existing file names, paths, and JSON configurations must be maintained.
-   Mobile responsiveness and proper alignment on all screen sizes are required.
**Scale/Scope**: Affects all content within the `/book/docs` directory and related styling files.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Clarity**: Code is clear and concise.
- [x] **Testability**: All code is testable.
- [x] **Documentation**: All new features are documented.
- [x] **Modularity**: Components are modular and reusable.
- [x] **Simplicity**: The solution adheres to YAGNI principles.
- [x] **Verifiability**: Content is clear and verifiable.

```

**Structure Decision**: The existing Docusaurus project structure will be utilized. Custom styling will primarily reside in `book/src/css/custom.css`. New Docusaurus theme components (e.g., for module cards, callouts) may be added within `book/src/components/` or overridden within the Docusaurus theme configuration. Modifications are strictly limited to UI/presentation and will not alter content logic or navigation files.
